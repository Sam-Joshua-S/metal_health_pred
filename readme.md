# Mental Health Prediction

This project aims to predict an individual's risk of developing a mental health condition using machine learning techniques. It utilizes demographic information and self-reported mental health assessments to make these predictions.Mental health prediction can identify individuals at risk of developing a mental health condition early on, allowing for earlier interventions and increasing the likelihood of successful treatment. It also allows for scalability and personalization of predictions using machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started
- Collect and clean data on individuals' demographic information and self-reported mental health assessments.
- Preprocess the data for use in machine learning models. This may include normalizing numerical values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Train machine learning models, such as logistic regression or decision trees, on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy and AUC-ROC.
- Use the best performing model to make predictions on new individuals' data.

# Limitations
- The quality and quantity of data can affect the accuracy of the predictions. It's important that the data is representative and complete.
- The choice of machine learning model and parameters can also impact the performance. It's important to try different options and compare the results.
- Predictive models are not always 100% accurate and therefore can't replace professional assessment, it's important to use the predictions as a tool to identify individuals that might benefit from professional help.
# Conclusion
Mental health prediction is an important task that can help identify individuals at risk of developing a mental health condition early on. By using machine learning techniques on demographic information and self-reported mental health assessments, it is possible to make accurate predictions of an individual's risk. The predictions can be used as a tool to identify individuals that might benefit from professional help.
